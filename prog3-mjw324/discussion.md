The loop unrolling techniques I used for the poly function had various combinations of accumulator amount, re-association (a), and iteration reduction amount. The specific combinations used were 2x1, 4x1, 2x1a, 4x1a, 4x2a, and 4x4 loop unrolling. For degree 100000, the baseline execution time with no optimizations was at 20,117. Both 2x1 and 4x1 (without re-association) only reduced this execution time to 18043 and 17937, respectively. When adding re-association to the same functions used before, the baseline execution time is significantly reduced by more than 50% with 2x1a and 4x1a getting 10031 and 8201, respectively. 4x2a and 4x4 are within the same reduction amount, with both getting 8746 and 9923 respectively. 

With exception to increasing the accumulators to 4 in 4x4, the loop unrolling techniques that didn't use re-association weren't nearly as efficient. The most efficient technique used was 4x1a, with a 59% reduction from baseline. Adding one more accumulator to the same technique resulted in less reduction. The biggest factors observed with reducing execution time were adding re-association, and decreasing the number of loop iterations.
